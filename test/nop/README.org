#+TITLE: The =nop= Test

The principle of this test is to write the same PPX rewriter with different
techniques and check that the same file, rewritten with the different PPXes,
gives codes that have the same semantics. For this example, we write various
files which use =%nop= structures. These structures should behave just like their
non-annotated counterparts. We then rewrite them with different “nop” PPXes that
do not alter the semantics of the program. We check that all rewritten codes run
in the same way.
